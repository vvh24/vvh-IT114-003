### **Project Description**

**Project Name:** Trivia  

This project involves creating a trivia game server and client that supports multiple simultaneous players. The server will handle complex data exchanges, manage player statuses, and ensure smooth gameplay with features like locking answers, syncing scores, and allowing late joiners to view the current game state. A graphical user interface (GUI) is integrated for better user interaction, offering features such as connecting to the server, participating in ready checks, and viewing live game updates.

**Core Functionalities:**
- **Server Features**: Efficient handling of multiple clients, structured data exchange, and graceful error handling.
- **Gameplay**: Players answer trivia questions, score points, and view live leaderboards.
- **GUI Integration**: Panels for connection, ready checks, gameplay, and events.
- **Roles**: Supports both active players and spectators with distinct functionalities.

**Highlights:**
- Dynamically loaded questions and categories.
- Diminishing scoring based on response order.
- Comprehensive session management, including end-of-session resets.
